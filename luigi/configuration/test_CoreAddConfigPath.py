Scenario 1: Validate config file existence
Details:
  TestName: test_add_config_path_file_existence
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles the case when the provided path does not refer to an existing file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a path that does not refer to an existing file.
  Act: Call the add_config_path function with the prepared path.
  Assert: The function should return False and a warning about a non-existing file should be issued.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure the function correctly handles invalid inputs and prevents further processing when a non-existing file is provided.

Scenario 2: Validate parser selection by file extension
Details:
  TestName: test_add_config_path_parser_selection
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly selects the parser based on the file extension.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a path to a file with a known extension that corresponds to one of the available parsers.
  Act: Call the add_config_path function with the prepared path.
  Assert: The function should not raise any exceptions and a warning should be issued if the selected parser differs from the default one. 
Validation:
  This is important to ensure that the function correctly selects the parser based on the file extension, which is a key part of its functionality.

Scenario 3: Validate behavior with an unsupported file extension
Details:
  TestName: test_add_config_path_unsupported_extension
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles the case when the file has an extension that does not correspond to any available parser.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a path to a file with an unsupported extension.
  Act: Call the add_config_path function with the prepared path.
  Assert: The function should select the default parser and a warning about an invalid parser should be issued.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function can correctly fall back to the default parser when an unsupported file extension is provided, which is a key part of its error handling.

Scenario 4: Validate behavior when the parser is not enabled
Details:
  TestName: test_add_config_path_parser_not_enabled
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles the case when the selected parser is not enabled.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the environment so that the selected parser is not enabled.
  Act: Call the add_config_path function with a path to a file with an extension that corresponds to the disabled parser.
  Assert: The function should raise an ImportError indicating that the parser is not installed.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function correctly signals when a required parser is not available, which is a key part of its error handling.
