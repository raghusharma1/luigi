Scenario 1: Test Singleton Creation
Details:
  TestName: test_singleton_creation
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the singleton instance is created correctly when it is not already present.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the logging function to avoid real logging during the test. Initialize a class with the function instance and the _instance attribute set to None.
  Act: Call the instance method with appropriate arguments.
  Assert: Check if the _instance attribute of the class is not None.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the singleton pattern is correctly implemented. The singleton pattern restricts a class to instantiate its multiple objects. It is essential for cases where we need to control the object creation.

Scenario 2: Test Singleton Retrieval
Details:
  TestName: test_singleton_retrieval
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the existing singleton instance is returned when it already exists.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a class with the function instance and the _instance attribute set to an object.
  Act: Call the instance method.
  Assert: Check if the returned object is the same as the one set in the _instance attribute.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the singleton pattern is correctly implemented by not creating a new instance when one already exists. This is crucial for maintaining a consistent state across the application.

Scenario 3: Test Singleton Reload and Logging
Details:
  TestName: test_singleton_reload_and_logging
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the reload method is called and a log is written when a new singleton is created.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the logging and reload functions. Initialize a class with the function instance and the _instance attribute set to None.
  Act: Call the instance method with appropriate arguments.
  Assert: Verify that the reload method was called once and that the logging function was called with the correct arguments.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the singleton is properly reloaded when created and that an appropriate log message is written. This is important for maintaining the correct state of the singleton and for tracking its creation in the logs.
