```
Scenario 1: Test with Existing Section
Details:
  TestName: test_getintdict_with_existing_section
  Description: This test is intended to verify the functionality of the getintdict method when a section that exists in the data is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the data with a section containing some key-value pairs.
  Act: Invoke the function with the name of the existing section.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the dictionary of key-value pairs from the section.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly retrieves the dictionary of an existing section. This is crucial as it is the primary function of getintdict.

Scenario 2: Test with Non-Existing Section
Details:
  TestName: test_getintdict_with_non_existing_section
  Description: This test is intended to verify the functionality of the getintdict method when a section that does not exist in the data is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the data with some sections, none of which match the section name to be tested.
  Act: Invoke the function with the name of the non-existing section.
  Assert: The expected outcome is an empty dictionary.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly handles non-existing sections by returning an empty dictionary. This is important for error handling and avoiding crashes when invalid section names are provided.

Scenario 3: Test with Empty Section
Details:
  TestName: test_getintdict_with_empty_section
  Description: This test is intended to verify the functionality of the getintdict method when an empty section is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the data with a section that contains no key-value pairs.
  Act: Invoke the function with the name of the empty section.
  Assert: The expected outcome is an empty dictionary.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly handles empty sections by returning an empty dictionary. This is important for maintaining consistency in the function's return type.

Scenario 4: Test with None Section
Details:
  TestName: test_getintdict_with_none_section
  Description: This test is intended to verify the functionality of the getintdict method when None is provided as a section.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the data with some sections.
  Act: Invoke the function with None as the section.
  Assert: The expected outcome is an empty dictionary.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly handles None as a section by returning an empty dictionary. This is important for error handling and avoiding crashes when None is provided as a section.
