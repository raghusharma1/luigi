Scenario 1: Test for successful interpolation when the environment variable exists
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_interpolation
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the before_get method successfully interpolates the value of an existing environment variable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an environment variable that the method will use for interpolation.
  Act: Invoke the before_get method, passing in a string that references the set environment variable.
  Assert: Check that the returned string is the expected interpolated value.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the before_get method performs interpolation correctly when the environment variable exists, which is essential for the method's functionality.

Scenario 2: Test for InterpolationMissingEnvvarError when the environment variable does not exist
Details:
  TestName: test_missing_envvar_interpolation_error
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the before_get method raises an InterpolationMissingEnvvarError when the environment variable does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that the environment variable referenced in the test does not exist.
  Act: Invoke the before_get method, passing in a string that references the non-existent environment variable.
  Assert: Check that an InterpolationMissingEnvvarError is raised.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the before_get method appropriately raises an error when it attempts to interpolate a non-existent environment variable, which is crucial for error handling.

Scenario 3: Test for correct operation when the value does not contain any environment variables
Details:
  TestName: test_no_envvar_in_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the before_get method returns the original value when it does not contain any environment variables.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a value that does not contain any references to environment variables.
  Act: Invoke the before_get method, passing in the prepared value.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the same as the original value.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the before_get method handles values without environment variables correctly, which is important for the method's flexibility.

Scenario 4: Test for correct operation when the value contains multiple environment variables
Details:
  TestName: test_multiple_envvars_in_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the before_get method correctly interpolates multiple environment variables in a value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set multiple environment variables and prepare a value that references all of them.
  Act: Invoke the before_get method, passing in the prepared value.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the expected interpolated value.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the before_get method can handle values with multiple environment variables, which is essential for the method's versatility.
